2.6. Bonfire test  
2.6.1.  General  
The bonfire test is designed  to demonstrate that a container complete with the 
fire protection system, specified in the design, will prevent the burst of the 
container when tested under the specified fire conditions. The manufacturer 
shall describe the behaviour of the complete fire protection system including 
the designed drop to atmospheric pressure. The requirements of this test shall 
be deemed to be fulfilled for any container having the following characteristics 
in common with the parent container:  
(a) Same  type approval owner,  
(b) Same  shape (cylindrical, special shape),  
(c) Same  material,  
(d) Same  or greater wall thickness,  
(e) Same  or smaller diameter (cylindrical container),  
(f) Same  height or smaller height (special container shape),  
(g) Same  or smaller external surface,  
(h) Same  configuration of accessories fitted to the container .1  
2.6.2.  Container set -up

manufacturer with the container bottom approximately 100 mm above 
the fire source.  
(b) Shielding shall be used to prevent direct flame impingement on the 
fusible plug (PRD) if present. The shielding shall not be in direct 
contact with the fusible plug (PRD).  
(c) Any failure during the test of a valve, fitting or tubing that is not part of 
the intended protection system for the design shall invalidate the result.  
(d) Containers with a length of less than 1.65 m . The center  of the container 
shall be positioned over the center  of the fire source.  
  
 1  Additional accessories, modifications and extensions of the accessories fitted to the container is 
possible without retesting, if notified to the Type Approval Authority which approved the container, 
considered  to be unlikely to have an appreciable adverse effect. The Type Approval Authority may 
require a further test report from the Technical Service responsible. The container and its configurations 
of accessories will be indicated in the appendix to Annex 2B. Multivalve or, when approved separately, 
pressure relief valve (discharge valve) and pressure relief device, extended for technical modifications 
and marked in accordance to Annex 2A need to have a new bonfire test. The container and its 
configurations of accessories will be indicated in the appendix to Annex 2B.  

E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.66/Rev. 6 
E/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.66/Rev. 6 
Annex 10  
 
108 (e) Containers with a length equal to or larger than 1.65 m . If the container 
is fitted with a pressure relief device at one side, the fire source shall 
commence at the opposite side of the container. If the container is fitted 
with pressure relief devices at both sides, or at more than one locat ion 
along the length of the container, the center  of the fire source shall be 
centered  midway between the pressure relief devices that are separated 
by the greatest horizontal distance.  
2.6.3.  Fire source  
A uniform fire source of 1.65 m length shall provid e direct flame impingement 
on the container surface across its entire diameter.  
Any fuel may be used for the fire source provided that it supplies uniform heat 
sufficient to maintain the specified test temperatures until the container is 
vented. The arrang ement of the fire shall be recorded in sufficient detail to 
ensure that the rate of heat input to the container is reproducible. Any failure 
or inconsistency of the fire source during a test shall invalidate the result.  
2.6.4.  Temperature and pressure meas urements  
 During the bonfire test the following items shall be measured:  
(a) The fire temperature just below the container, along the bottom of the 
container, at minimum two locations, not more than 0.75 m apart;  
(b) The wall temperature in the bottom of t he container;  
(c) The wall temperature within 25 mm from the pressure relief device;  
(d) The wall temperature on the top of the container, in the centre of the 
fire source;  
(e) The pressure inside the container.  
 Metallic shielding shall be used to prevent  direct flame impingement on the 
thermocouples. Alternatively, thermocouples may be inserted into blocks of 
metal, measuring less than  25 mm2. During the test the thermocouple 
temperatures and the container pressure shall be recorded at intervals of 
2 seconds or less.  
2.6.5.  General test requirements  
(a) Container shall be filled with 80 per cent in volume of LPG 
(commercial fuel) and tested in the horizontal position at working 
pressure;  
(b) Immediately following the ignition, the fire shall produce flame 
impingement on the surface of the container, along 1.65 m length of the 
fire source across the container;  
(c) Within 5 minutes of ignition at least one thermocouple shall indicate 
the temperature of fire just below the container of at least 590 °C.  This 
temperature shall be maintained for the remaining duration of the test, 
namely until when no overpressure is present in the container;  
(d) The severity of the test conditions shall not be mitigated by ambient 
conditions (e.g. rain, moderate/high wind etc.).

(b) A pressure of more than 3,700 kPa, i.e. 136 per cent of the set pressure 
of the PRV (2,700 kPa), during the test shall invalidate the test result.  
 A pressure between 3,000 and 3,700 kPa shall only invalidate the test 
result in case visible plastic deformation is observed.  
(c) In case the behaviour of the protection system does not comply with the 
specification of the manufacturer and it leads to a mitigating test 
condi tion the result shall be invalidated.  
(d) For a composite container a release of LPG via the surface is accepted 
in case of a controlled release. A release of gaseous LPG within 2 
minutes after the start of the test or a release capacity of more than 
30 litres per minute shall invalidate the test result.  
(e) The results shall be presented in a test summary and shall include the 
following data for each container as a minimum:

Annex 1 4 
 133 Annex  14 
  Provisions regarding the approval of the electronic control 
unit 
1. The electronic control unit can be any device which controls the LPG demand 
of the engine and establishes the cut -off of the remotely -controlled service 
valve(s), cut -off valves and fuel pump of the LPG system  in case of a broken 
fuel supply pipe or/and in case of stalling of the engine.  
2. The switching off delay of the service cut -off valves after stalling of the engine 
may not be more than 5 seconds.  
2.1. Notwithstanding the provis ions of paragraphs 1. and 2.  above , the remotely 
controlled service valve(s) and shut -off valves may st ay in an open position 
during the commanded stop phases.  
3. The electronic control unit shall comply with relevant electromagnetic 
compatibility (EMC) requirements according to Regulation No. 10, 02 series 
of amendments or equivalent.  
4. Electrical failure of the vehicle system may not lead to uncontrolled opening 
of any valve.  
5. The output of the electronic control unit shall be ina ctive when the electric 
power is switched off or removed.  
6. When the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) is intended to be fitted as a 
component of an interconnected  LPG -system, it shall inhibit, by controlling 
the fuel selection system, the vehicle operation i n petrol mode after each 
switch -over operation to LPG mode until a volume of liquid fuel equivalent to 
that flown into the LPG tank during such an operation is consumed.  
 Notwithstanding this, the ECU may permit the switch over to petrol mode if a 
fault in  the LPG -system determines the inoperability of the system. Such a fault 
shall be clearly indicated to the driver.  
 In case of the inoperability of the LPG -system, a remotely controlled shut -off 
valve complying with the requirements of paragraph 6.17.3.3. shall be installed 
along the flow line in order to prevent any flow of petrol into the LPG container 
after switching -over to petrol mode.  
6.1. The maximum volume of liquid fuel that flows during a switch -over operation 
shall not exceed 0.4 litre and the mi nimum volume of the tank shall not be 
lower than 20 litres.  
6.2. To verify compliance with paragraph 6. of this annex, the ECU shall be tested 
as follows:  
 (a) Install the LPG -system on a vehicle;  
 (b) Set the fuel selection system in LPG mode;  
 (c) Warm up the engine until all temperatures of cooling and lubrication 
means and the pressure of lubrication means have reached equilibrium;  
 (d) Let the engine run at the lowest idling speed;  
 (e) Switch over from LPG mode to petrol mode and vice versa;

E/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.66/Rev. 6 
Annex 1 4 
134  (f) Set the fuel selection system in petrol mode.  
 Test interpretation  
  The criteria adopted for the interpretation of the test is as follows:  
  (i) Petrol mode is disabled until a volume of liquid fuel equal to 0.4 
litre is consumed. Such consumption shall  be calculated by a test 
bench measuring device. It may be calculated making use of the 
fuel flow signals of the LPG ECU read out by means of an 
appropriate scan tool, if the reliability of such signals has been 
previously verified.  
 The test shall be repe ated also at the highest idling speed.  
6.3. To measure the volume of liquid fuel that flows during the switch -over 
operations, the following test shall be carried out:  
(a) Install the LPG -system other than the container on a vehicle;  
(b) Place the containe r on a weighing system and fill up the LPG tank;  
(c) After having pressurized the LPG -system up to the normal operating 
conditions, record the reading of the weighing system (W1);  
(d) Disable the ECU feature described in paragraph 6. above;  
(e) Switch -over from LPG to petrol and vice versa for at least 10 times;  
(f) Record the reading of the weighing system (W2).  
The volume of petrol flown per switch -over operation shall be calculated as 
follows:  
Vsw = (W2 -W1) / #SW / Dpetrol  
where:  
Dpetrol = 743  kg/m3; 
#SW = number of switch -over operations from LPG to petrol mode and vice 
versa during the test.  
The weighing system shall have the following:  
(a) A precision of ± 0.02 per cent of full scale or better;  
(b) A resolution of 20 g;  
(c) An accuracy of ± 2 per cent of the reading or ± 0.3 per cent of full scale 
whichever is better.  
6.4. The ECU shall bear a marking with the following data clearly legible and 
indelible:  
(a) the wording "ICS"; and  
(b) the value of 0.4 litre; and  
(c) the approval mark according to paragraph 5.4. of this Regulation.

outlet open. A positive shut -off valve and a pressure gauge having a pressure 
range of not less  than 1.5 times nor more than 2 times the test pressures are  to 
be installed in the pressure supply piping. The pressure gauge is to be installed 
between the positive shut -off valve and the sample under test. While under the 
applied test pressure, observat ions for leakage are to be made with the open 
outlet submerged in water unless otherwise indicated.  
8.1.2.  Conformance with paragraphs 8.2. to 8.8. below is to be determined by 
connecting a length of tubing to the valve outlet. The open end of this outlet 
tube is to be located within an inverted graduated cylinder which is calibrated 
in cubic centimetres. The inverted cylinder is to be closed by a water seal.  The 
apparatus is to be adjusted so that:

Annex 1 6 
 141 water level within the inverted graduated cylinder, and  
(b) The water within and exterior to the graduated cylinder is at the same 
level. With these adjustments made, the water level within the 
graduated cylinder is to be recorded. With the  valve in the closed 
position assumed as the result of normal operation, air or nitrogen at the 
specified test pressure is to be applied to the valve inlet for a test period 
of not less than  2 minutes. During this time, the vertical position of the 
graduat ed cylinder is to be adjusted, if necessary, to maintain the same 
water level within and exterior to it.  
At the end of the test period and with the water within and exterior to the 
graduated cylinder at the same level, the level of water within the graduat ed 
cylinder is again recorded. From the change of volume within the graduated 
cylinder, the leakage rate is to be calculated according to the following 
formula:

shall be capable of indicating accurately, for the test fluid employed, the 
maximum leakage flow rates permitted.  
8.2. The seat of a shut -off valve, when in the closed position , shall be free from

10. Operational tests  
10.1.  Operation test of the (gas -tube) pressure relief valve  
10.1.1.  In the case of pressure relief valves, three samples of each size, design, and 
setting are to be used for start -to-discharge and resealing pressure tests. This 
same set of three valves is to be used for flow capacity tests for other 
observations indicated in the following paragraphs.  
Not less than two successive start -to-discharge and resealing pressure 
observations are to be made on each of the three test valves under test No. 1 
and 3 of paragraphs  10.1.2. and 10.1.4. below.  
10.1.2.  Start-to-discharge and resealing pressures of pressure relief valves - test No. 1  
10.1.2.1.  Before being subjected to a flow capacity test, the start -to-discharge pressure 
of each of three samples of a pressure relief valve of a specific size, design, 
and setting shall be within +3 per cent of the average of the pressures, but the 
start-to-discharge pressure of any one of t he three valves shall be not less than 
95 per cent, not more than 105 per cent, of the set pressure marked on the valve.  
10.1.2.2.  The resealing pressure of a pressure relief valve before being subjected to a 
flow capacity test shall be not less than 50 pe r cent of the initially observed 
start-to-discharge pressure.  
10.1.2.3.  A pressure relief is to be connected to an air or other aerostatic supply source 
capable of being maintained at a pressure of at least 500 kPa effective pressure 
above the marked set p ressure of the valve being tested. A positive shut -off 
valve and a pressure gauge having a pressure range of not less than 1.5 times 
nor more than 2 times the test pressure are to be installed in the pressure supply 
piping. The pressure gauge is to be inst alled in the piping between the valve 
being tested and the positive shut -off valve. Start -to-discharge and resealing 
pressure are to be observed through a water seal not over 100 mm in depth.  
10.1.2.4.  After recording the start -to-discharge pressure of the  valve, the pressure is to 
be increased sufficiently above the start -to-discharge pressure to ensure 
unseating of the valve. The shut -off valve is then to be closed tightly and the 
water seal, as well as the pressure gauge, are to be observed closely. The 

E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.66/Rev. 6 
E/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.66/Rev. 6 
Annex 1 6 
144 pressure at which bubbles through the water seal cease is to be recorded as the 
resealing pressure of the valve.  
10.1.3.  Flow capacity of pressure relief valves - test No. 2  
10.1.3.1.  The flow capacity of each of three samples of a pressure relief valve of  a 
specific size, design, and setting shall fall within a range of 10 per cent of the 
highest observed capacity.  
10.1.3.2.  During flow capacity tests on each valve, there shall be no evidence of 
chattering or other abnormal operating condition.  
10.1.3.3.  The blow -down pressure of each valve shall be not less than 65 per cent of the 
initially recorded start -to-discharge pressure.  
10.1.3.4.  A flow capacity test on a pressure relief valve is to be conducted at a flow 
rating pressure of 120 per cent of the maxi mum set pressure.  
10.1.3.5.  A flow capacity test on a pressure relief valve is to be conducted by utilizing a 
properly designed and calibrated orifice flowmeter of the flange type 
connected to a source of air supply of adequate capacity and pressure.  
Modi fications of the flowmeter from that described herein, and an aerostatic 
flow medium other than air, may be used provided the end results are the same.  
10.1.3.6.  The flowmeter is to be arranged with sufficiently long lengths of pipe both 
preceding and foll owing the orifice, or other arrangements including 
straightening vanes, to assure no disturbance at the orifice place for the ratios 
of orifice to pipe diameters to be employed.  
Flanges between which the orifice plate is located and clamped are to be 
provided with pressure take -off lines connected to a manometer. This 
instrument indicates the pressure differential across the orifice plate and the 
reading is used in the flow calculation. A calibrated pressure gauge is to be 
installed in that portion of the meter pipe downstream of the orifice plate.  This 
gauge indicates the flow pressure and the reading is also used in the flow 
calculation.  
10.1.3.7.  A temperature -indicating instrument is to be connected to the meter pipe 
downstream of the orifice plate  to indicate the temperature of the air flowing 
to the safety valve. The reading of this instrument is to be integrated in the 
calculation to correct the temperature of the air flow to a 15  °C base 
temperature. A barometer is to be available for indicating  the prevailing 
atmospheric pressure.  
The reading of the barometer is to be added to the indicated air -flow gauge 
pressure. This absolute pressure is similarly to be integrated in the flow 
calculation. The air pressure to the flowmeter is to be controlled by a suitable 
valve installed in the air -supply piping ahead of the flowmeter. The pressure 
relief valve under test is to be connected to the discharge end of the flowmeter.  
10.1.3.8.  After all preparations for flow capacity tests have been made, the valve  in the 
air-supply line is to be opened slowly and the pressure to the valve under test 
is to be increased to the appropriate flow rating pressure. During this interval, 
the pressure at which the valve "pops" open is to be recorded as the popping 
pressure.  
10.1.3.9.  The predetermined flow rating pressure is to be maintained constant for a brief 
interval until the readings of the instruments become stabilized. Readings of the 
flow pressure gauge, pressure differential manometer, and the flowing air 

E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.66/Rev. 6 
E/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/A dd.66/Rev. 6 
Annex 1 6 
 145 temperatu re indicator are to be recorded simultaneously. The pressure is then to 
be decreased until there is no further discharge from the valve.  
The pressure at which this occurs is to be recorded as the blow -down pressure 
of the valve.  
10.1.3.10.  From the recorde d data and the known orifice coefficient of the flowmeter, the 
air-flow capacity of the pressure relief valve tested is to be calculated using the 
following formula:  
60ph1.0 FFQt b =
 
Where : 
Q = Flow capacity of pressure relief valve in m3/min. of ai r at 100  kPa 
absolute and 15  °C. 
Fb = Basic orifice factor of flowmeter at 100 kPa absolute and 15  °C. 
Ft = Flowing air temperature factor to convert recorded temperature to base 
of 15  °C. 
h = Differential pressure across orifice of meter in kPa.  
p = Flowing air pressure to pressure relief valve in kPa absolute (recorded 
gauge pressure plus recorded barometric pressure).  
60 = Denominator to convert equation from m3/hour to m3/min.  
10.1.3.11.  The average flow capacity of the three pressure relief valves  rounded off to the 
nearest five units is to be taken as the flow capacity of the valve of that specific 
size, design and setting.  
10.1.4.  Recheck start -to-discharge and resealing pressures of pressure -relief -valves 
test No.  3 
10.1.4.1.  Subsequent to flow capacity tests, the start -to-discharge pressure of a pressure 
relief valve shall be not less than 85 per cent, and the resealing pressure shall 
be not less than 80 per cent of the initial start -to-discharge and resealing 
pressures recorded under test No. 1  of paragraph 10.1.2.  above.  
10.1.4.2.  These tests are to be conducted approximately 1 hour after the flow capacity 
test, and the test procedure is to be the same as described under test No. 1 of 
paragraph  10.1.2.  above.  
10.2.  Operation test excess flow va lve 
10.2.1.  An excess flow valve shall operate at not more than 10 per cent above, nor less 
than 20 per cent below the rated closing flow capacity specified by the 
manufacturer, and shall close automatically at a pressure differential across the 
valve of n ot more than 100 kPa during the operation tests described below.  
10.2.2.  Three samples of each size and style of valve are to be subjected to these tests. 
A valve intended for use only with liquid is to be tested with water, otherwise 
the tests are to be m ade both with air and with water. Except as indicated in 
paragraph  10.2.3.  below , separate tests are to be run with each sample installed 
in vertical, horizontal and inverted positions. The tests with air to be made 
without piping or other restriction conn ected to the outlet of the tests sample.  
10.2.3.  A valve intended for installation in one position only may be tested only in that 
position.  

E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.66/Rev. 6 
E/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.66/Rev. 6 
Annex 1 6 
146 10.2.4.  The test with air is to be conducted by utilizing a properly designed and 
calibrated orifice flowmeter of the flange type, connected to a source of air 
supply of adequate capacity and pressure.  
10.2.5.  The test sample is to be connected to the outlet of the flowmeter. A manometer 
or calibrated pressure -gauge reading in increments of not more than 3 kPa is 
to be installed on the upstream side of the test sample to indicate the closing 
pressure.  
10.2.6.  The test is conducted by slowly increasing the flow of air through the 
flowmeter until the check valve closes. At the instant of closing, the pressur e 
differential across the flowmeter orifice and the closing pressure indicated by 
the gauge are to be recorded. The rate of flow at closing is then to be calculated.  
10.2.7.  Other types of flowmeters and a gas, other than air, may be used.  
10.2.8.  The test  with water is to be conducted using a liquid flowmeter (or equivalent) 
installed in a piping system having sufficient pressure to provide the required 
flow. The system is to include an inlet piezometer or pipe at least one pipe size 
larger than the valve to be tested, with a flow control valve connected between 
the flowmeter and piezometer. A hose or hydrostatic relief valve, or both, may 
be used to reduce the effect of the pressure shock when the excess flow valve 
closes.  
10.2.9.  The test sample is to be connected to the outlet end of the piezometer. A 
manometer or calibrated pressure gauge of the retard type, which will permit 
readings in the range of 0 to 1,440 kPa is to be connected to a pressure take -
off on the upstream side of the test sample to indic ate the closing pressure.  The 
connection is to be made using a length of rubber hose between the pressure 
gauge and the pressure take -off, with a valve installed at the gauge inlet to 
permit bleeding air from the system.  
10.2.10.  Prior to the test, the fl ow control valve is to be opened slightly, with the bleed 
valve at the pressure gauge open, to eliminate air from the system. The bleed 
valve is then to be closed and the test is conducted by slowly increasing the 
flow until the check valve closes. During the test the pressure gauge is to be 
positioned at the same level as the test sample. At the instant of closing, the 
rate of flow and closing pressure are to be recorded. When the excess flow 
valve is at cut -off position, the leakage or by -pass rate of flo w is to be recorded.  
10.2.11.  An excess flow valve used in the assembly of a filling unit shall close 
automatically at a pressure differential of not more than 138 kPa when tested 
as described below.  
10.2.12.  Three samples of each size of valve are to be s ubjected to these tests. The tests 
are to be made with air, and separate tests are to be run with each sample 
mounted vertically and horizontally. The tests are to be conducted as described 
in paragraphs  10.2.4. to 10.2.7.  above , with a filling unit hose c oupling 
connected to the test sample and with the upper non -return valve held in the 
open position.
